# StormRPC âš¡

StormRPC is an abstraction or wrapper on [`nats.go`]'s Request/Reply messaging capabilities.

It provides some convenient features including:

* **Middleware**

    Middleware are decorators around `HandlerFunc`s
* **Body encoding and decoding**

    Marshalling and unmarshalling request bodies to structs. JSON, Protobuf, and Msgpack are supported out of the box.
* **Deadline propagation**

    Request deadlines are propagated from client to server so both ends will stop processing once the deadline has passed.
* **Error propagation**

    Responses have an error attribute and these are propagated across the wire without needing to tweak your req/resp schemas.
